# FantasyLeagueGedoens

Since there was no propper Fantasy League for both LEC and LCS anymore, we had to do it ourselves. This is a first implementation that works with Python and uses the Google-Sheets-Api to connect to our spreadsheet where all points, drafted (and not drafted) players etc are stored

**TODO:**

-Add check when Updating Matchups to not allow updating of old matchups after week is over.

-Add functionality to differentiate between different weeks in player-lists (lec-spieler, lcs-spieler)

  -->Maybe add a column for each week and one for the accumulated sum and one for average?


  -->Include that in how we calculate all points 
  
  -->Add points to total points and each week

-Add documentation and annotations
